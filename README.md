~/workspace/ $ # Let's create 2 new directories A1 and A2 by using command mkdir
~/workspace/ $ mkdir A1 A2
~/workspace/ $ #We can easily navigate between them by using command cd                                                                    
~/workspace/ $ cd A1
~/workspace/A1/ $ # Now we are in directory A1

~/workspace/A1/ $ cd
~/workspace/ $ # And now let's go to A2 
~/workspace/ $ cd A2
~/workspace/A2/ $ # Let's create 3 files in directory A2
~/workspace/A2/ $ # We can create files by using command " touch " 
~/workspace/A2/ $ touch B1 B2 B3
~/workspace/A2/ $ # You can see all items in directory by using command " ls " 
~/workspace/A2/ $ ls
B1  B2  B3
~/workspace/A2/ $ # Let's delete file B3 by using command rm
