From Newbies for Newbies: BASH! Why BASH? https://youtu.be/YHoiQ2b5YzE

code:
~/workspace/ $ # Why should you choose BASH?
~/workspace/ $ # Well.. If you are LINUX user, then the answer is quite obvious, isn't it? It's the most convenient for you.
~/workspace/ $ # But if you don't use LINUX on daily basis, why choose BASH?
~/workspace/ $ # Let's start on a fun note. Imagine waking up after a long long nap. Your phone is dead. Your computeris playing tricks on you for months and been showing the wrong date. How to know what date is it? OF COURSE BY USING BASH! Just type in command $cal and BASH will show you today's date.
~/workspace/ $ # Try it, it's fun, isn't it? :)
~/workspace/ $ # But on a more serious note. BASH helps you to easily create new directories and files as well as manage them in no-time.
~/workspace/ $ #Let's try it together. Create a new directory by writing a command mkdir
~/workspace/ $ mkdir NEW
~/workspace/ $ # Now let's create a new file
~/workspace/ $ touch FILE1
~/workspace/ $ # Easy, rightt? :)
~/workspace/ $ ^Chat's it for today. But for more about directories & files - stay tuned.

From Newbies for Newbies: BASH! Files and Directories https://youtu.be/SC0CQm6gaqc

code:
~/workspace/ $ # BASH allows you to easily work with different directories and files.
~/workspace/ $ # Let's create 2 new directories A1 and A2 by using command mkdir
~/workspace/ $ mkdir A1 A2
~/workspace/ $ #We can easily navigate between them by using command cd                                                                    
~/workspace/ $ cd A1
~/workspace/A1/ $ # Now we are in directory A1
~/workspace/A1/ $ # To switch between directories, we firstly need to exit this one by using command cd
~/workspace/A1/ $ cd
~/workspace/ $ # And now let's go to A2 
~/workspace/ $ cd A2
~/workspace/A2/ $ # Let's create 3 files in directory A2
~/workspace/A2/ $ # We can create files by using command " touch " 
~/workspace/A2/ $ touch B1 B2 B3
~/workspace/A2/ $ # You can see all items in directory by using command " ls " 
~/workspace/A2/ $ ls
B1  B2  B3
~/workspace/A2/ $ # Let's delete file B3 by using command rm
~/workspace/A2/ $ rm B3
rm: remove regular empty file ‘B3’? yes
~/workspace/A2/ $ # Now let's see what's changed
~/workspace/A2/ $ ls
B1  B2
~/workspace/A2/ $ # That's a basic tutorial how to navigate between directories and files. :)
~/workspace/A2/ $ 

From Newbies for Newbies: BASH! Editing Options in BASH https://youtu.be/Du4Hy8js74Y

code:
~/workspace/ $ # Today we're gonna learn basics to editing files in BASH
~/workspace/ $ # Let's create a new directory and 2 new files
~/workspace/ $ mkdir TEST
~/workspace/ $ touch F1 F2
~/workspace/ $ # To add content to files we use command echo
~/workspace/ $ echo "test F1 " > F1
~/workspace/ $ echo " test F2 " > F2
~/workspace/ $ # to revise information we have in different files, command cat comes in handy
~/workspace/ $ cat F1 F2
test F1 
 test F2 
~/workspace/ $ # For adding extra line to file, we use echo as well
~/workspace/ $ echo " extra line " >> F2
~/workspace/ $ cat F2
 test F2 
 extra line 
~/workspace/ $ # For creating new files and working in them, we can use different editors, one of them being nano.
~/workspace/ $ # to open nano just type: nano
~/workspace/ $ nano
~/workspace/ $ # we just created a new file.
~/workspace/ $ ls TEST
~/workspace/ $ #w~e can check the content in file nano                                                                                    
~/workspace/ $ cat nano
This is nano. 
We can type here whatever we want.
to save file click ctrl+ o
to exit nano click ctrl + x

~/workspace/ $ # deleting files are easy as well. just use command rm
~/workspace/ $ rm F1
rm: remove regular file ‘F1’? yes
~/workspace/ $ # those are the basics of editing in BASH. :)
~/workspace/ $
